To make the implementation easier, we can separate message retrieval and message sending into two browsers. This will make things easier in the short term.

### SQLite Database Structure

#### Scheduled Messages

- **Fields:** chatID, provider, time to send, message

#### Mapper

_(Helper for identifying the correct chatID)_

- Maps a number to a chatID
- Maps username + provider to chatID
- Maps group name + provider to chatID
  - Note: Each group has a unique chatID, unlike individual users.

#### Chats

Consider adding a provider column (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, etc.).

| Chat ID | Message ID | Provider                | Sender | Time Sent | Message |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
|         |            | WhatsApp / Telegram etc |        |           |         |

| Forwarded     | Replying to Message | Attachment                  |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| True \| False | False \| Message ID | False \| Attachment Details |

**Primary Key:** Chat ID + Message ID

#### Attachment Details

- **Type:** Image, PDF, Other
- **Size:** In bytes or megabytes
- **Link:** (to the actual attachment)
  - Attachments may be stored in a separate database or within the same one.
- Additional details as necessary.

#### x-cortex Processing Queue

Queue of messages that are to be processed by x-cortex and later scheduled to be sent to the respective recipients.


#### Message Processing in x-cortex

When a new message is added to the database, the corresponding chatID is added to the x-cortex processing queue, provided the sender is not "You" and the chatID is not already present. If x-cortex is available, it retrieves the previous x messages from the relevant chatID and creates scheduled messages as needed.
